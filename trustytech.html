                        TrustyTech is a mobile application that aims to <b>build trust between home service providers and their customers, in order to increase the comfort of unsupervised appointments.</b> Through enabling home service appiontments without the need of customer presence, customers no longer have to worry about being at home during long appointment windows, and technicians are able to efficiently add more jobs throughout the day. This allows <b>both parties to be more in control of their schedules.</b> Not only does TrustyTech resolve the issue of scheduling, it also provides an additional value to the home service provider since the recorded livestream videos could be used for training. Thus, <b>both the high costs of rescheduling and training could be reduced by TrustyTech.</b>

                        To design a mobile application that brings two different user roles with different goals together in completion of a common task. The challenge is to identify a novel way to co-create value for both users while taking into consideration their varying needs.

                    <h5>understanding the current state</h5>
                    <p>
                        By synthesizing our knowledge of the problem space using an <b>ecosystem collection</b>, we revealed what we already know and what we need to learn. <br><br>We identified the following <em>gaps in our knowledge:</em>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the logistics of technicians scheduling their visits?</li>
                        <li>What are the steps that customers take to schedule home service requests?</li>
                        <li>What are customers comfortable with?<br>(Multiple technicians at once? Can technicians come in without the customer present?)</li>
                        <li>What tools/services currently exist in the home services area?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        We conducted <b>guerilla research</b> to rapidly fill in the gaps in knowledge of the home services space. I suggested that we <b>interview local technicians and customers who have recently scheduled a home service request.</b> Our goal was to learn more about how home service providers handle and schedule their requests, and understand customers' experiences with scheduling home service requests. We also conducted <b>competititve analysis</b> research online to see what existing services and products are currently available in this space.

                    <h4>REFRAMING THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <h5>taking a different approach</h5>
                    <p>
                        Instead of trying to design yet another application that focuses on optimizing the scheduling process between home service providers and customers, we decided to approach the problem from a different angle, focusing on <b>building trust</b> between customers and home service providers so that we can <b>eliminate scheduling and rescheduling problems altogether.</b>

                    <h4>VISIONING</h4>
                    <h5>user scenarios & storyboards</h5>

                    <p>
                        To explore as many wild ideas as possible, we generated a variety of user scenarios that focuses on building the trust between home service providers and customers. We selected a final scenario and created storyboards to show how value is co-created. 
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Value for Scott, the Customer</strong><br>
                        Scott is able to take on an extra substitute job despite the unexpected heater issue. Our solution frees him from the burden of having to wait around at home for a technician, which allows him to keep his schedule open and do the things that he actually wants.
                    </p>

                        Our application makes the employees’ jobs significantly more efficient because they no longer need to deal with customers rescheduling or cancelling appointments, or not being home at the scheduled time. They also no longer have to worry about running late to appointments.

                    <h5>pitch presentation feedback</h5>


                    <p>
                        <em>We received the following feedback based on our first pitch:</em>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Does this really enforce trust or does it make the technicians feel monitored and micromanaged?</li>
                        <li>Does the progress bar enforce trust?</li>
                        <li>How is the phone mounted on? What if the technician's hands are dirty?</li>
                        <li>How can the technician enter the home?</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>


                <p>
                    <em>The following changes were made in response:</em>

                <ul>
                    <li>Reframed the livestreaming as a showcase that can provide evidence of the technician's skills and the work they do during the repair. This can also help justify any large bills.</li>
                    <li>Removed the progress bar as its added benefits were not aligned with our goals.</li>
                    <li>Emphasized that the livestream puts all parties (customer, technician and home service provider) at ease for unsupervised services.</li>
                    <li>Researched and recommended possible hardware that home service providers can buy to facilitate mounting a phone for hands-free recording.</li>
                </ul>
