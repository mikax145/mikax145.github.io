                    <p>
                        Based on personal interest, I joined a group of MBA students working on a start-up idea as a design consultant to help guide and launch a product for East Asian advanced English learners. Since most existing English-learning tools are geared toward beginners and intermediates, we saw a market opportunity for a tool for advanced English learners. <b>I worked on this project from end to end, leading the user research and designing the final MVP.</b>

                    <h5>no easy way for East Asians to study & practice English, especially for advanced learners</h5>
                    <p>
                        Learning a new language is hard. Getting to advanced/native proficiency is even harder - languages have nuances and are culturally charged. Exisiting tools and services for English learning in East Asia are limited and insufficient, especially for advanced-level learners. Tools like Duolingo and Rosetta Stone are geared toward beginners and intermediates, and tutors and English classes take too much time. <b>How can we help East Asian advanced English learners improve their English skills more efficiently?</b>
                    </p>

                <!--
current tools/study methods for advanced English learners are time-consuming & boring

Their original idea was a mobile and/or desktop app that curates English articles for East Asians who want to advance in their careers.

                        To uncover the needs of our target population, I took the lead on kicking off our user research. I proposed that we survey advanced East Asian English learners to understand their practices, methods, and thoughts about the tools they currently use to study English. We gained confirmation that <b>current tools are insufficient as over 50% either self-teach or do not use any tools/services.</b> 
                        <br><br>
                        The common themes that emerged from our survey responses then guided our interview questions with learners, tutors, and teachers. We identified the following key user needs from our survey analysis and affinity diagramming:

                    <p>Now that we've identified our key user needs, we led an ideation session with the MBA students to brainstorm as many solutions for each user need. Our favorite/most promising ideas were the following 6:

                <h4>PRODUCT DECISIONS</h4>

                <h5>use user feedback to prioritize product features</h5>
                <p>From our speed-dating tests with 6 users, the top 3 features were:
                </p>


                <div class="center-div">
                    <figure class="center">
                        <img src="Images/flyh/top3.png">
                    </figure>
                </div>

                <h5>personalization by interest & difficulty level is key</h5>
                <p>
                    Based on these results, we decided to incorporate the following features in our first prototype:

                <ul>
                    <li>Study content based on user's interests and hobbies</li>
                    <li>Content that adjusts to user's difficulty level</li>
                    <li>Autonomous repetition of words/phrases in multiple contexts</li>
                    <li>Automatic progress tracking</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

            <div class="center-fullpage">
                <figure class="center">
                    <img src="Images/flyh/idea1.png">
                </figure>
            </div>
            <figcaption>Low-fidelity wireframes of our first product idea, a Coffee Meets Bagel-style app that feeds users 3 study materials per day based on interest and difficulty level.</figcaption>


            <h4>ITERATIONS</h4>
            <h5>fail fast, iterate fast - accept when users debunk your hypothesis</h5>
            <p>We were so excited about our first product idea and thought that advanced English learners would love our Coffee Meets Bagel-style idea. However, upon
                <b>testing with 6 users and pitching to 2 VCs</b>, we found that our users:
            <ul>
                <li>liked the idea of the app, but probably wouldn't use it</li>
                <li>didn't want "lecture-based" study materials</li>
                <li>didn't want to download a separate mobile app</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <p>   
            Another key finding was that beginner-level learners or those who are specifically studying to pass an English exam (e.g., TOEFL for study abroad) would use "lecture-based" materials, but <b>advanced speakers don't want to spend extra time learning English - they want to have fun during the process.</b>
        </p>

        <h5>attempt #2: shifting to an experience-centric approach</h5>
        <p>Our feedback led us to <b>focus more on experiences and strategies to gain users.</b> After a second round of ideation, our top idea was a <b>Facebook plugin that curates "learning experiences" based on interests and location.</b> Users can try out a class for free, then later buy package deals. I had really high hopes for this idea since "English Cafes" (a native speaker facilitates casual English conversations with a group of learners) are so popular in Japan. 
        </p>

            <figure class="center">
                <img src="Images/flyh/idea2.png">
            </figure>
        </div>
        <figcaption>Inspired by Airbnb "Experiences", we designed an experience-based solution for advanced learners to improve their skills while doing other activities, like cooking, karaoke, and painting.</figcaption>



        <h5>design with the user's culture in mind</h5>
        <p>Sadly, our idea was shut down by our users again - <b>all 6 users that we tested with responded negatively.</b> The main complaints were that going out to learn English was too bothersome and they were afraid of embarrassing themselves by speaking English with strangers.</p>



        <h5>mix & match to create a good balance</h5>
        <p>
            From our first concept, <b>users loved the idea of video curation based on interest and difficulty level.</b> since it's fun and not "study-based". In addition, we found an opportunity to utilize existing platforms and content like Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix. Our MBA team <b>met with over 20 VC teams and investors in Silicon Valley, some of which were very interested in the idea of bringing American content to East Asian countries for English learning.</b>
